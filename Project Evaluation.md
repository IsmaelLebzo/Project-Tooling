## Task 2
There are many risks may happen in the process of developing the application,
- like the user wont accept the application.\
We solved it by keeping in touch with user from the feedback he gave us.
- The budget is low for the website.\
We solved it by increasing the budget a bit more and get as much free help as we can.
- Changing the plane from the stakeholders them selfs.\
We just kept contacting him as much as we can so keep the project up to date for the requirement he added, and after Im done with some of the project I send it to him to check on it to see if he have some comments on it so I can fix it.

## Task 3
The stengths of our website:
1. It's clear and easy to use for the user.
2. It's designed on one color templet so that would give it a better look.
3. It has a local storage that can keep the order of the user even if the page get refreshed.\

The weaknesses of our website:
1. It doesn't have a cloud storage to keep the data of the user (not yet).
2. It's still not fully produced so it cant be like if u checkout its not going to make an order it just gonna clear the cart and give an alert of success.
