# Stage 1
## Task 2
1. **Visual Studio Code vs PyCharm:**\
 When compared to PyCharm, Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is considerably quicker. When compared to PyCharm, it is incredibly light. Visual Studio Code is the clear victor when it comes to a modular approach to wiring code. Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE) contains a large number of extensions, add-ons, and other libraries.
-----
**Linux vs Windows:** 
- **Windows**\
With an estimated 87.89 percent of PCs running some variation of Windows, it is clearly the most popular operating system in terms of market share.\
Some individuals have difficulty using Windows for more complex development tasks, such as getting Docker containers to work, having issues with Node and npm, and so on. One reason for this is because Windows' default command line application is PowerShell, which is very different from Bash, which is used on most Linux systems.\
However, all you actually need for basic web coding is an editor like VSCode, which is another Microsoft tool.\
Microsoft has recently embraced open source technology, allowing you to use Windows Subsystem for Linux to install things like a Bash terminal. These developments should help bridge the gap between Windows and Unix-based operating systems like MacOS and Linux.
- **Linux**\
Linux is widely used. It's what powers the internet, with Unix and Unix-like operating systems powering around 67 percent of all web servers in 2016.\
However, desktop Linux is only installed on around 1.72 percent of all desktop PCs, and its popularity has been steadily declining over time.\
Developers, on the other hand, love Linux since it's free and allows them to rapidly install anything they need for their development environment.\
Not all gadgets, however, work well with Linux. The Linux kernel, distributions (operating systems that use the Linux kernel, such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Red Hat, and others), and application developers are all mostly open source initiatives. This implies they're primarily funded by volunteers who devote their spare time to these initiatives.
-----
**Github vs Gitlab**\
Making changes to existing source code and, in certain cases, producing new source code are all part of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Because most developers were working on various areas of the code at the same time, the changes in the code might occasionally clash. This will very certainly bring unwelcome problems into the software. While these may not have an immediate impact on software development, they may cause serious mistakes in the future, making it difficult to pinpoint the issue zone.\
The platform each ideology offers is the main distinction between GitHub and GitLab. GitLab is more focused on delivering a features-based system with a centralized, integrated platform for web developers, whereas GitHub offers superior availability and is more focused on infrastructure performance.\

GitHub's Advantages and Disadvantages:\
**Advantages:**
- For the open-source codebase, this is an incredible system.
- Allows for simple sharing
- Offers pull requests and comments and has a sophisticated and user-friendly UI.
- Has a sizable population
- Remote cooperation is possible because to the simple setup.
- It has characteristics that make it simple to control.\
**Disadvantages:**\
- Doesn't have a great API development team.
- For those looking for a private repository, it's a little pricey.
- It does not have many features.\

GitLab's Advantages and Disadvantages\
**Advantages:**

- Has a steady stream of fresh features
- Pull requests and code reviews are available.
- Has any CLI experience?
- Provides package management services.
- The CI/CD lifecycle is supported.
- Codes are simple to maintain.

**Disadvantages:**\
- Upgrade procedure that is problematic
- Some enterprise-level functionalities are missing.
- There are a lot of bugs in this game.
- A small group of people

2. I choosed the following tools VSC (Visual Studio Code), Windows (but using ubuntu in the terminal) and last but not least is Github.\
I think choosing these is a good way to interduce us to developing my application I think they are easy to use the help alot with writing a code like the VSC it has many languages and extentions we can add to help me write a code for my application.\
And choosing Windows for me its better than Linux because I see Linux as a complicated Boot System and since I was young I used to work and do all my stuff on Windows, so I kinda have an experience in it, but did git ubuntu on the terminal.\
As a Version-control platform I choosed Github because it is home to a Developer community of over 27 million people.\
There are almost 80 million projects on GitHub. It's the world's largest code repository, allowing people to create, share, and contribute to open source projects.\
It has projects written in over 300 different programming languages.\
It is mostly employed in open source projects.

3. As I said in the last part of this task:\
The IDE I choosed is VSC (), It's easy to use and have so many extinions can be added to help even more with writing the code, and it is an open sorce, secured.
The Operating System I'm running Windows but when I want to write, add, edit a code I open the terminal which I use the Ubuntu there.
The Version-control platform I'm using Github for many reasons which are:\
The GitHub Developer community has grown to nearly 27 million members.\
Over 80 million projects are hosted on GitHub. It's the world's largest code repository for developing, sharing, and contributing to open source projects.\
It has approximately 300 programming languages represented in its projects.\
It's mostly utilized in open-source projects.
