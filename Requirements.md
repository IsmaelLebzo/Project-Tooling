# Stage 1
## Task 1
1. I choosed to make a application project about a Coffee Store which is called Coffee Land, The stakeholders told me  to make a website for the Coffee shop, it should have Home page, Menu page, About-us page, Cart page and a Host-An-Event page.\
The Home page is a welcoming page for the user to see what the website is all about.\
The Menu page is where the user can see what products does the shop sell.\
The About-us page is to tell the user about the shop it self (information).\
The Cart page is where the user should proceed to buy the product he wants which he added to the cart from the menu page.\
The Host-An-Event page its a page where the user can host an event in the store he can add his info and what time he want to host this event.
----
2. There are many risks may happen in the process of developing the application, like the user wont accept the application, or the budget is low for the website,and changing the plane from the stakeholders them selfs, that can cause so many problems for me as a devolper of this application.
----
3. 
 - The requirments for this site is to have a website where the user can check the Coffee Shop and can make an order of what type of coffee he want and how many, or can make a event in the shop it self what day what time and how many people.
 ----
 - So I use the storage to save the order that the user is putting so I can show it for him in the cart page like to get the total for the order.
