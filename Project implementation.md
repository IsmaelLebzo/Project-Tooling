# Stage 2
## Task 1
This will be a Power Point presentation, and all the feedback that I got on the application was positive they all loved it.

## Task 2
Here is the link for the final resualts of the application. \

## Task 3
As I said before the feedback we got was all positive on the final resualt of the application, but we got some feedback before the we presented the final resualts like, the header of the website (nav) should be shown all the time while you are scrolling down the page, seconed thing was the images should have the same spacing between them (margin).\
And stuff I see its good to be added is to save the user info but that we didn't learn it yet we will learn about how to do that in code fellows 301, I think if we had more time for the application we could added another page for the user login.
One of the improvment that we did is to add the total to the menu page not just the cart page.
